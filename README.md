# Compiler-Design
The goal of our project this semester is to develop a prototype C compiler. This is 
done by compiling C programs into processors such as x86, MIPS, ARM, or pseudo 
assemblies. In this class, we will use LLVM IR as the target code. The project is 
divided into several parts including language definition, lexical analyzer, 
C-grammar, symbol table handlings, parser, and code generation.
